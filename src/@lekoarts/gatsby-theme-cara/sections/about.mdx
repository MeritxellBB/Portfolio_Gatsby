## About

> I would like you to know me a little more, so here is a small summary about me

Recently, with the intention to overturn my professional career, I've completed a <b>Full Stack development bootcamp</b> to be able to direct my career to what has always been my passion, the field of web development. What's more, I can complement it with my knowledge about <b>digital marketing</b> and <b>communication corporate</b>, studies in which I have invested part of my time over the past few years and have awakened my curiosity and my desire to continue growing personally and professionally. Time is now!
